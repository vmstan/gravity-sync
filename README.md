# Gravity Sync

</span>

###

What is better than a [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) blocking trackers, advertisements, and other malicious domains on your network? That's right, **two** Pi-hole blocking all that junk on your network!

- [Seriously. Why two Pi-hole?](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/wiki/Frequent-Questions#why-do-i-need-more-than-one-pi-hole)

But if you have redundant Pi-hole in your network you'll want a simple way to keep the list configurations and local DNS settings identical between the two. That's where Gravity Sync comes in. Setup should only take a few minutes.

## Features

Gravity Sync replicates the core of Pi-hole's resolver settings, which includes:

- Adlist settings with status and comments.
- Domain whitelist and blacklist along with status with comments.
- Custom RegEx whitelist and blacklists.
- Clients and groups, along with any list assignments.
- Local DNS Records.
- Local CNAME Records.

### Limitations

Gravity Sync will **not**:

- Modify the individual Pi-hole's upstream DNS resolvers.
- Sync DHCP settings or monitor device leases.
- Merge long term data, query logs, or statistics.

## Setup Steps

1. [Review System Requirements](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/wiki/System-Requirements)
2. [Install Gravity Sync](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/wiki/Installing)
3. [Configure Gravity Sync](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/wiki/Installing#configuration)
4. [Execute Gravity Sync](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/wiki/Engaging)
5. [Automate Gravity Sync](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync/wiki/Automation)

## Disclaimer

Gravity Sync is not developed by or affiliated with the Pi-hole project. This is project an unofficial, community effort, that seeks to implement replication (which is currently not a part of the core Pi-hole product) in a way that provides stability and value to Pi-hole users. The code has been tested across multiple user environments but there always is an element of risk involved with running any arbitrary software you find on the Internet.
